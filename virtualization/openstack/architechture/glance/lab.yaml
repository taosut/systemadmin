Install and configure Glance Service


1. To create the database, complete these steps:

Use the database access client to connect to the database server as the root user:
# mysql
Create the glance database:
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE glance;
Grant proper access to the glance database:

MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON glance.* TO 'glance'@'localhost' \
  IDENTIFIED BY 'abc@123';
MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON glance.* TO 'glance'@'%' \
  IDENTIFIED BY 'abc@123';
Replace abc@123 with a suitable password.

Exit the database access client.
